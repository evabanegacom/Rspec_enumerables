# Rspec_enumerables

Test for enumerables

This is a collaborative project about testing the some of the ruby(s) enumerables

It is is a Test Driven Development (TDD) project using Rspec to ratify the functionalities of

my own ruby's enumerables project by testing them with various conditions as they apply.
this way we can identify how well my own version of the Ruby's enumerables meet the functionality
of the original enumerable by comparing them using rspec.
